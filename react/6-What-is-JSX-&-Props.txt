-----------What is JSX?------------

JavaScript eXtension, or JSX, is a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows us to write HTML-like code in our JavaScript files.
It's not HTML, but it looks a lot like it. It's a way of writing HTML in JavaScript.

Antes solo con dom:

function MyComponent() {
  return React.createElement("div", null, "Hello, world!");
}

Ahora con jsx:

function MyComponent() {
  return <div>Hello, world!</div>;
}


---------------Props---------------

Props are the inputs to the component function - just like arguments to a function. You pass props like you use HTML attributes, 
and they are available inside the component function as an object. We usually call the object props but you could call it anything.

function MyComponent(props) {
  return <div>Hello, {props.name}!</div>;
}

<MyComponent name="world" />;


You can pass multiple attributes to the Component and read multiple values from the props object.

function MyComponent(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      Hello, {props.firstName} {props.lastName}!
    </div>
  );
}

<MyComponent firstName="John" lastName="Smith" />;


ðŸ’­ You can't change props inside a component directly, they are read-only. This is how we make sure things stay in sync. 
The data comes from outside the component. The component renders what it is given. If it needs to change the data, there are other ways. 
This is called "uni-directional data flow", and is one of the core principles of React's approach.
